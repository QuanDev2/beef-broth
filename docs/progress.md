## Session Log

<!-- YYYY-MM-DD | Week X Day Y | Topic | Duration | Key insight or deviation -->

### Week 2, Day 1 — Vision calls: image → description
Date: 2026-06-25
Status: done

Completed:
- Started `sandbox/caption.py`: loads `photos/saigon-1.webp`, base64-encodes the bytes, sends it to the vision model and prints the description
- Path anchored to the script via `Path(__file__).parent` (not cwd) so it works when imported/run from anywhere
- Built the multimodal message shape: `content` is a list of blocks — an `image` block (`source: {type: base64, media_type: image/webp, data}`) plus a `text` block ("Describe this photo.")
- Reused `call_llm` from `llm.py` unchanged — it passes `messages` straight through, so the same text wrapper handles vision (Week 1 consolidation paying off)
- First real caption returned: correctly identified Ho Chi Minh City, colonial + modern architecture, motorbikes, etc.

Notes:
- Cost lesson felt directly: the image was **1552 input tokens** vs ~16 for a text prompt (~100×). Images tokenize by dimensions (photo was 3100×2069). This is the concrete reason for the cheap-before-expensive ordering — de-dupe free local CLIP first, caption only survivors (Week 4)
- Output was freeform markdown and hit the `max_tokens=256` cap (cut off mid-sentence). Pretty for humans, unparseable for code — motivates Day 2 (structured `{content, mood, quality_flags}` JSON via `call_llm_structured`)
- Sample is `.webp` (web download). API supports webp fine; real ~30-photo set should be JPEGs (phone-realistic) before Day 6 batch
- Repo hygiene: caption.py commit (`b3b2889`) also pulled in the 620K image binary plus `.vscode/`/`.claude/` settings. Decide whether to `.gitignore` `sandbox/photos/` before adding the full set (~18MB of binaries otherwise lands in a public repo)

### Week 1, Day 7 — Consolidate `llm.py` helper
Date: 2026-06-25
Status: done

Completed:
- Extracted the duplicated token/cost-reporting block (copy-pasted across both functions) into one module-private `_report_cost(usage)` helper; both `call_llm` and `call_llm_structured` now call it
- Removed Day-6 leftovers: the now-redundant `system=` JSON-API prompt on the structured path (`messages.parse` constrains shape at decode time), the dead `prompt` variable, and the unused `ValidationError` import
- `__main__` now demonstrates both paths in one run: a text call (`call_llm`, "Describe Saigon in one sentence") and a validated-JSON call (`call_llm_structured` → `NoteSummary`)
- Verified by running: text call 16 in / 49 out; structured call 281 in / 93 out (schema input-token cost as seen Day 6); structured returns a validated `NoteSummary` object

Notes:
- Week 1 complete. `sandbox/llm.py` is the reusable wrapper every later job (`caption.py`, `story.py`, `match.py`) imports: messages/system/temperature/max_tokens, cost logging, text + validated-structured paths
- Kept Haiku prices (`0.80`/`4.00`) inline rather than hoisting to named constants — fine at one model; revisit when a second model enters
- `_report_cost` is defined below its callers (works — name resolved at call time); left as-is
- Untracked `.vscode/` not committed; candidate for `.gitignore`

### Week 1, Day 6 — Structured JSON output
Date: 2026-06-20
Status: done

Completed:
- Added `call_llm_structured(messages, schema, ...)` to `sandbox/llm.py` with a Pydantic `NoteSummary` model
- First built the post-hoc validation path: requested JSON, hit the two real failures (code-fence wrapper → invalid JSON; wrong-shape keys like `trip_summary`), forced shape via a JSON-API system prompt + assistant prefill (`"{"`), and added a `try/except ValidationError` failure path
- Then refactored to the modern path: `client.messages.parse(output_format=schema)` → `response.parsed_output` returns a validated object with no system prompt, no prefill, no fence-stripping, no manual validation

Notes:
- Prefill (`"{"`) works on Haiku 4.5 but 400s on Opus 4.6+/Fable 5 — it's the legacy technique; structured outputs (`output_config.format` / `messages.parse`) is the current standard, with strict tool use as the other option
- Structured outputs costs input tokens for the schema (121 → 328 on this call); SDK caches a compiled schema ~24h so repeat calls with the same schema amortize it
- Leftover in `__main__`: still passes the now-unneeded `system=` and defines an unused `prompt`/`system` — harmless cruft to clean up on the Day 7 consolidation

### Week 1, Day 5 — System prompts
Date: 2026-06-14
Status: done

Completed:
- Added `system: Optional[str] = None` parameter to `call_llm()`
- Used `**kwargs` pattern to conditionally pass `system` only when not None (API rejects `system=None`)
- Demonstrated behavior change: same Saigon prompt produced different style with vs without system prompt
- System prompt added 16 tokens to input cost (17 → 33)

Notes:
- Python 3.9 requires `Optional[str]` from `typing` — `str | None` is 3.10+ only
- Anthropic SDK raises 400 if `system=None` is passed explicitly — must omit the key

---

### Week 1, Day 4 — Temperature and params
Date: 2026-06-14
Status: done

Completed:
- Added `temperature` and `max_tokens` as parameters to `call_llm()` with defaults (0 and 256)
- Ran same prompt 3× at temp 0 (identical token counts, near-identical output) and 3× at temp 1 (varied length and phrasing)
- Confirmed Anthropic caps temperature at 1.0 (not 2 like some other providers)

Notes:
- Captioning and matching steps will run at temp 0 for repeatability; story step may go slightly higher (0.3–0.5) if style variation is wanted

---

### Week 1, Day 3 — Tokens, context window, cost
Date: 2026-06-14
Status: done

Completed:
- Added token + cost reporting to `sandbox/llm.py`: prints input/output tokens and USD cost per call
- Observed Turn 2 input tokens jump from 17 → 74 (statelessness — full transcript resent)
- Cost formula: input * (0.80/1M) + output * (4.00/1M), formatted with `:.6f`

Notes:
- Output tokens cost 5× more than input on Haiku; shapes downstream design (keep output short/structured)

---

### Week 1, Day 2 — Messages, roles, statelessness
Date: 2026-06-14
Status: done

Completed:
- `call_llm` refactored to accept `messages: list[dict]` instead of a bare string
- Two-turn Saigon exchange built manually (user → assistant → user)
- Demonstrated forgetting by stripping history from the second call

Notes:
- Standing rule added to skill + memory: never auto-edit sandbox/app files during teaching

---

### Week 1, Day 1 — Python env + first API call
Date: 2026-06-14
Status: done

Completed:
- Virtualenv set up in `sandbox/.venv`, deps installed from `requirements.txt`
- `sandbox/llm.py` written: one function, hard-coded Saigon prompt, raw response printed
- Real API call confirmed working; `.env` verified git-ignored
- Repo published to GitHub: https://github.com/QuanDev2/beef-broth

Notes:
- Model set to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for cheap iteration; will make it a parameter on Day 7
- README updated for GitHub audience before pushing
